												<p>Our teachers are trained to maximise your exposure to the target language during your lessons. They will predominantly use the target language and encourage you to do so. The teacher should be able to clarify meaning through teaching aids like pictures and mime. If you still have trouble understanding something then your teacher will help however they can.</p>

												<p>All our teachers are native speakers and hold an International House Teacher Training Certificate. Lessons focus on oral communication and include work on reading, writing and grammar. From the first lesson your teacher will speak in the target language. They will use teaching aids such as audio, video, pictures and mime, to help you understand. Being immersed in the language requires you to actively work out meaning which improves your ability to remember and recall what you have learnt.</p>
